## dcp/wallet

The Wallet API is a library for working with DCP and DCP Bank Accounts. The two main functions provide jobs access to a keystore to allow deployment on DCP:

- gets a keystore from the wallet
- gets a keystore from the disk

A DCP bank account stores credits. Doing work on the network earns credits, and deploying work consumes them. A keystore is a special file that grants access to credits with public key/private key cryptography. One can create several keystores to separate or manage funds.

A keystore has a public address. As DCP Workers earn credits, they deposit them into the keystore associated with the payment address specified in the Worker’s configuration. Set this to the public address of a keystore to change where earned credits go.
